- LMDB and GDBM seem good databases
	I'm evitating sqlite3 because I don't want SQL strings
	or I can use an ORM
	
	If doing it in C, learn autotools.
	There are a bunch of articles out there.

- Multi-calendar
- Text processing
	Add at least italic.
- Verbose optimization
	`pastel add "A new task"`
	`pastel add note "A new note"`
	`pastel done`

To mask some task as done I thought about separating them by index
and not ID. So `pastel done 3` marks the third task in the day as done.
This way less information needs to be on the screen. But the user will
still need to brain a bit, thing which the idea of making the current-time
task different-colored was trying to prevent.
