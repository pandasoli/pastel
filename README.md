### <samp>Pastel

**Pastel** is an open-source, self-organizer task list CLI program
I'm planning and making myself, and for myself use. All features
and use cases are made based on my personal use and needs.

I really encourage you not using this app, instead
learn the code and make your own.

# <samp>Usage
</div>

```sh
$ todo add "Some task for today next fiting hour" ...
$ todo done 3 ...  # Mark 3rd todo as done
```

For todos management the index of it in the today's list is used.  
It seems help the interface's development since no technical info need to be available (i.e. UUID).
